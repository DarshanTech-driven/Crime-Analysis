# Crime Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview
This project goal is to build interactive Tableau dashboards that help law enforcement understand crime patterns and trends across the city, supporting investigation, resource planning, and crime-prevention strategies.

## Objectives
- Analyze overall crime statistics across the city (count and type of crimes).
- Visualize crime locations on a geo-map highlighting recent incidents.
- Study crime distribution over time (day of week, hour, and time blocks).
- Analyze year-wise crime trends and changes in incident reporting.
- Compare incidents with arrests vs. without arrests, and identify severe/domestic incidents.
- Provide interactive filters for incident type and location for granular analysis.
